h2.  Summary

This example shows using a Cyclic Barrier Terracotta.  A [Cyclic Barrier|http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html] is used as an execution synchronization point, or rendezvous, point across multiple threads.  

With Terracotta, a clustered Cyclic Barrier can coordinate threads on a single VM, or across VMs. This demonstration will show coordination across two VMs.
