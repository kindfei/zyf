h1.  Single Resource Example

h2.  Summary

This example shows how to make one and only one node manage a resource.  When that node leaves the cluster, another node will acquire the resource.

This particular example is creating a resource that is local to the VM that acquires the lock.  It would be easy to make the resource clustered, simply remove the transient keyword from the definition.

h2.  How to run

*Node 1:*
{code}
$ javac *.java
$ start-tc-server &amp;
$ dso-java Main
I'm waiting for the lock...
I'm creating the resource
(wait for the other node to join)
(press Ctrl-c)
{code}

*Node 2:*
{code}
$ dso-java Main
I'm waiting for the lock...
(after pressing Ctrl-c on the first node)
I'm creating the resource
{code}
