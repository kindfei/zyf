h1.  FutureTask Example

h2.  Summary

This example demonstrates using a FutureTask to send a message from a Producer app to a Consumer app, and demonstrates the asynchronous nature of a FutureTask working across more than one physical JVM using Terracotta.

The first node to start will listen for FutureTask objects, and execute them when received.  Subsequent nodes will create a new FutureTask, push it into the queue, then wait for it's execution to complete and print the result of the execution.
