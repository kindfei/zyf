h1.  Hello World Example

h2.  Summary

This example shows the most basic usage of Terracotta.  It shows a simple clustered POJO, which has a single integer field {{counter}}.  The POJO has a main method, which invokes the {{run}} method on a singleton instance of the POJO.  The singleton instance is declared as a root, which gives the POJO it's clustered ability via Terracotta.
