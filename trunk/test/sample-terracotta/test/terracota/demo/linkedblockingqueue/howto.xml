h2.  Summary

This example shows how to send messages across VMs (threads) using a [LinkedBlockingQueue|http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingQueue.html].

This example will show pushing Date objects through the queue.  The first node to start will listen for Date objects, and print them when received.  Subsequent nodes will create a new Date and push it in to the queue.
